<h2> Hi there, welcome to my page about languages </h2>
<img src="http://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8100/8634097456_0af1f2d5b3.jpg">
<p>Photo by:<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nhan-non/">Nhan</a></p>
<p> This page will cover some of the language I like to learn and some travel photos that I've taken. More on my albums here on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nhan-non/">Flickr</a> 

<p> Here are some of the languages I'd like to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>French</li>
<li>Mandarin Chinese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a link to another <a href="http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/">language blog</a>.</p>
<p>I like that this website has a static navigation bar that follows your screen as you scroll down. There's also a pop-up to notify the user to subscribe to his newsletter, which I think is a nice touch. Overall I prefer this blog structure.</p>

<p> Let me know which language you're interested in learning! </p>
